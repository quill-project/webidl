# webidl
Generator for Quill packages from Web IDL files.

This repository is both a Javascript tool for generating Quill bindings for Javascript APIs from IDL files and at the same time a Quill package that provides the needed structures and functions for the former to work.

### Package

The Quill package defines structures such as `js::JsValue`, `js::JsObject`, `js::Record[T]`, `js::Promise[T]` and so on. It is used by all bindings generated by the tool, and so any Quill packages that contain bindings generated by this tool should have this package (`https://github.com/quill-project/webidl`) as a dependency.

### Generator

Usage:
1. Put any `.idl` or `.webidl` files into the `sources`-directory (any other files will be ignored).
2. Run `index.js`:
```
node index.js <MODULE_NAME>
```
3. The output will be written to `output.quill`. The output Quill symbols of all IDL input files will be inside the module specified by `<MODULE_NAME>`, and the module will be depend on the Quill package inside this repo (`https://github.com/quill-project/webidl`) and the standard library.
